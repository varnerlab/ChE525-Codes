# SolveBalances: Solves model equations from TSTART to TSTOP given parameters in data_dictionary.
# Username: jeffreyvarner
# Type:
# Version: 1.0
# Generation timestamp: 1-19-2016 1:33:16
#
# Input arguments:
# TSTART  - Time start
# TSTOP  - Time stop
# Ts - Time step
# data_dictionary  - Data dictionary instance (holds model parameters)
#
# Return arguments:
# TSIM - Simulation time vector
# X - Simulation state array (NTIME x NSPECIES)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# Get required stuff from DataFile struct -
TSIM = collect(TSTART:Ts:TSTOP);
initial_condition_vector = data_dictionary["INITIAL_CONDITION_ARRAY"];

# Call the ODE solver -
fbalances(t,y,ydot) = Balances(t,y,ydot,data_dictionary,flow_function);
X = Sundials.cvode(fbalances,initial_condition_vector,TSIM,reltol=1e-4,abstol=1e-6);

return (TSIM,X);
